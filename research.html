    <p style="padding: 16px 38px;"><em><b>Summary.</b> We live in the Information Age. Innovations in information
        technology, such as the World Wide Web (a.k.a. the Web), play a pivotal role in advancing today's
        knowledge-based societies and should be protected at all costs. My research revolves around the security and
        privacy of the Web, with an emphasis on problems that impact the way we adopt and use its underlying
        technologies. My ultimate goal is to empower Web users by building software systems that are resilient to centralized control, give users full control
        of their data, and offer higher levels of privacy and security.</em></p>

    <div class="title">Background</div>
    <p>One characteristic of the Information Age is that our society is surrounded by a high-tech global economy in
      which wealth is knowledge and growth is learning. This system of the world leads to a fundamental question about
      our experience with the Web: When we go online, how do we identify ourselves, connect with others, and gain
      knowledge?</p>

    <p>When I started exploring this question in 2010, as part of an early investigation of Web single sign-on [<a
        href="#1">1</a>], the answer was predominantly "Facebook." True then as it is now, we live in the Facebook Age.
      We identify ourselves with our Facebook accounts, we connect with others by sending friend requests, and we learn
      about the world from our newsfeeds. For many, the Web has become Facebook; or Google, Twitter, and the like.
      Regardless of which “walled garden” we choose to visit, the Web is far distant from its open standard origin.
      Today’s Web is dominated by a few large websites that use closed, centralized systems. Moreover, most of these
      websites implement a business model that allows them to be used for free in exchange for user data, which is then
      used for highly-targeted advertising. Other than treating users as commodities, this “free-to-use” business model
      is fundamentally flawed. A price of zero greatly reduces liabilities to users, especially privacy and security,
      incentivizes the use of abusive retention strategies, which profile users and herd them towards sharing more data,
      and prohibits market learning by hiding pricing signals, which hinders competition and innovation. Yet, the Web
      seems to work well in practice, does it not? Starting early 2011, I set out to test this proposition, focusing on
      the privacy and security implications of using large, centralized websites like Facebook.</p>

    <div class="title">The Centralized Web: The Case Against Facebook</div>
    <p>As Facebook had 500 million monthly active users in 2011, and projecting its first billion within a year, I
      decided to investigate how feasible it is for an attacker to achieve a seemingly far-fetched goal: To automate,
      and effectively fake, the whole Facebook experience for many adversarial objectives, such as private data
      collections and misinformation.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="img/social_botnet.png" alt="Social botnet" style="width:360px;" />
      <br><span><b>Figure 1.</b> Social botnet</span>
    </div>

    <p>After presenting the case for this investigation to The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, I started
      designing a Web automation tool called a socialbot. In concept, a socialbot controls a fictitious Facebook account
      and can perform social activities similar to those of real users, such as sending friend requests and posting
      messages. As such, a socialbot is designed to deceive and pass itself off as a human being. A network of
      socialbots can be controlled by an adversary in a command-and-control fashion, similar to malware botnets. For a
      social botnet to operate at scale, all aspects of its operation must be automated, including account creation,
      profile setup, befriending, and posting messages. The main challenge is not automation per se, but being able to
      infiltrate and connect with the rest of the Facebook network. This is the case because successful social
      infiltration is essential for evaluating privacy and security concerns, as isolated socialbots pose minimal risk
      to users and are easy to detect. To overcome this challenge, the socialbots are designed to exploit known concepts
      in sociology, such as targeting users with whom they have mutual friends (i.e., triadic closure), in order to
      improve their infiltration success rate.</p>

    <p>After consulting with the university’s research ethics board, I carefully operated a network of 100 socialbots on
      Facebook for eight weeks, resulting in one main finding: With up to 80% infiltration rate, 250GB of raw data
      collected from more than one million users, and less than 20% detection rate, Facebook and its users are left
      defenseless [<a href="#2">2</a>,<a href="#3">3</a>]. This was the first comprehensive study that showed the
      vulnerability of large, centralized online social networks (OSNs) like Facebook to fake, abusive automation, and
      has received the outstanding paper award at ACSAC '11. It also resulted in a private presentation to the InfoSec
      Technology Transition Council for the Science & Technology Directorate at the U.S. Department of Homeland
      Security, in addition to an international news coverage, years before Facebook was formally questioned by the U.S.
      Senate about its handling of user data, fake news, and political bias in 2018.</p>

    <p>In 2012, shortly after this investigation, I started looking at how OSNs can protect their users from automated
      fake accounts [<a href="#4">4</a>]. Being closed and centralized, it is not possible to evaluate new defenses
      against the ones deployed by OSNs in practice, unless researchers find a way to collaborate with these OSNs. Back
      then, there were two main approaches to detect fake accounts. The first is statistical and relies on detecting
      anomalies in user behavior using machine learning. The second is mathematical and relies on computing properties
      of the social graph, which represents users and their friendships, using combinatorics and probability theory. In
      2013, I showed that both approaches are ineffective against socialbots, as their threat model assumes fake
      accounts that cannot behave like real users; they must be spammy and relatively isolated from real accounts [<a
        href="#5">5</a>]. This investigation resulted in the best paper award at ASONAM '13, and highlighted the
      challenge for designing defense systems that consider a more realistic and resourceful adversary who can operate a
      social botnet.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="img/integro.png" alt="Integro's high-level design" style="width:340px;" />
      <br><span><b>Figure 2.</b> Integro's high-level design</span>
    </div>

    <p>From 2014 to 2015, after studying the human factors affecting social infiltration [<a href="#6">6</a>], I worked
      on building and improving Integro: A defense system that combines both approaches in a novel,
      infiltration-resilient user ranking scheme that helps OSNs detect fake accounts [<a href="#7">7</a>,<a
        href="#8">8</a>]. Integro predicts victims of fake accounts (i.e., potential victims) using supervised machine
      learning, with features extracted from basic account information. As such, it makes no limiting assumptions about
      fakes and shifts the focus to real accounts. Integro weights the social graph such that edges incident to
      potential victims have lower weights than others. It then computes a rank for each account based on the landing
      probability of a short, modified random walk that starts from a known real account. This walk is biased towards
      traversing accounts that are reachable through edges with higher weights, which means it is highly unlikely to
      land on fake accounts and most real accounts will be ranked higher than fake accounts, even if fakes have
      infiltrated many real accounts.</p>

    <p>I implemented Integro on top of open-source distributed systems and deployed it at Tuenti, a progressive OSN with
      millions of users. A production-class evaluation resulted in detecting nearly 10 times more fake accounts than
      existing defense systems. This was done in under 30 minutes for a social graph with 160 million nodes on 33
      commodity machines.</p>

    <p>It is important to highlight that websites should take the initiative and integrate, or at least evaluate, new
      defense systems against theirs, hopefully before innovation is stifled by new, restrictive Web regulations that
      are drafted in response to emerging security and privacy concerns. This rings true with the new EU GDPR law put in
      place and the recent push in the U.S. to regulate high-tech companies.</p>

    <div class="title">The Decentralized Web: The Case for Bitcoin</div>
    <p>In 2016, I started exploring how victim prediction can be applied to different Web security problems [<a
        href="#9">9</a>]. I quickly realized, however, that this approach gives more legitimacy to collecting user data
      by closed, centralized systems. Moreover, operating “big data silos” will eventually be infeasible, as there will
      be far more data than a single, centralized system can manage for free.</p>

    <p>With this perspective in mind, I revisited the threat of social botnets as an instance of the Sybil attack, which
      is a well-studied problem in distributed, decentralized identity-based system, such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
      networks. In the Sybil attack, an adversary abuses the system by forging multiple, dishonest identities, each
      called a Sybil, and joins the system under these identities for malicious objectives. A decentralized, distributed
      system that is resilient to the Sybil attack is a good candidate for influencing the design of next-generation Web
      systems. This is when I shifted my focus to Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses a P2P network to move money from one user to another, each represented by
      a single node in the network, without the need for intermediaries, such as banks. Transactions are verified by
      loosely-organized nodes called miners and recorded in a public, distributed ledger called a blockchain. The
      security of the blockchain is established by a chain of cryptographic puzzles that miners compete to solve. Each
      miner that successfully solves a crypto puzzle is allowed to record a set of transactions, and to collect a reward
      in Bitcoins. The more mining power (i.e., resources) a miner applies, the better are its chances to solve the
      puzzle first. This reward structure, also called proof-of-work, provides an incentive for miners to contribute
      their resources to the system, and is essential to the currency’s decentralized nature.</p>

    <p>The Bitcoin network relies on IP address-based identity. In order to defend against Sybil attackers who attempts
      to fill the network with dishonest nodes, an honest node only makes an outbound connection to one IP address per
      /16 subnet (i.e., one IP out of a block of 65 thousand IPs). This reduces the probability of an honest node
      connecting to peers that are dishonest all the time. To defend against a Sybil attacker who controls miners,
      consensus in Bitcoin requires the majority of miners in the network to agree on the state of the blockchain. As it
      is financially infeasible for an adversary to control the majority of the mining power in the network, the
      security of the blockchain is preserved. This new crypto economy defined by Bitcoin is novel, and is already
      fueling new blockchain-based Web systems, such as Filecoin for data storage and Steemit for social networking.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="img/cibr-lab.png" alt="CIBR-Labs's high-level architecture" style="width:620px;" />
      <br><span><b>Figure 3.</b> CIBR's high-level architecture</span>
    </div>

    <p>In 2017, to better understand how decentralized systems like Bitcoin affect the way we use the Web, I started a new
      focused effort called <a href="https://cibr.qcri.org" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Initiative for Blockchain Research (CIBR)</a>,
      and kicked off the research by looking at ways to link off-chain data (e.g., a Twitter account) to on-chain data 
      (e.g., a Bitcoin address), focusing on applications related to privacy research and law enforcement. Existing blockchain 
      analysis systems, such as BlockSci, focus on efficiently analyzing on-chain data, with no or limited support for auxiliary data. To
      address this limitation, I am currently building and improving CIBR-Lab: A full-stack search, tagging, classification, and
      analysis system for blockchains [<a href="#10">10</a>,<a href="#11">11</a>]. The challenge is to find a way to systematically incorporate auxiliary data into the
      blockchain so that a new class of queries, which involve clustering, linking, classifying, and searching on/off-chain data, can
      be performed using existing analysis systems. CIBR-Lab addresses this challenge by annotating on-chain data with
      tags, which are auxiliary, off-chain data crawled from the Web and other information networks, such as Tor. These
      tags are managed separately from the analysis sub-system as annotations, which can be clustered, linked, classified, and
      searched through blockchain transactions. To simplify blockchain analysis, CIBR-Lab separates functionality by defining a
      component-based, layered system architecture (i.e., a stack), where blockchain, data management, annotation, and
      analytics have separate component with well-defined and extendable interfaces between them. This allows CIBR-Lab to provide quick, 
      partial answers to high-level queries like: "which Twitter accounts made Bitcoin payments to Silk Road."</p>

    <p>As a proof of concept, we deployed CIBR-Lab in 2019 to investigate emerging security and privacy issues arising from 
      analyzing off/on-chain data of popular technologies. In particular, we showed that one can deanonymize Tor hidden 
      service users [<a href="#12">12</a>], uncover Ponzi schemes on Bitcoin [<a href="#13">13</a>], and identify users 
      who made donations to open-source projects on GitHub[<a href="#14">14</a>]. My ongoing work with CIBR-Lab has led 
      to a private presentation to The Office of Technology Research and Investigation at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, 
      multi-year, multi-million dollar research grants from Qatar National Research Fund, and an international news 
      coverage.</p>

    <div class="title">Moving Forward: Towards a Private, Secure, and Decentralized Web</div>
    <p>For the short term, I plan to continue working on CIBR-Lab, focusing on fraud detection and transaction risk
      predictoin. I then plan to deploy CIBR-Lab as an interactive blockchain analytics service, with dashboards displaying 
      real-time results of important, user-defined queries. Based on feedback from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission 
      and Qatar Financial Center Regulatory Authority, such capabilities are extremely helpful to protect customers, 
      comply with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering laws, and draft new, investor-friendly cryptocurrency 
      regulations.</p>

    <p>For the longer term, I plan to analyze the privacy and security of general-purpose, decentralized Internet
      platforms, such as Ethereum, EOS, and IPFS, which are currently used to build next-generation websites in the new
      Web, or Web 3.0. As users
      should have the freedom to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to access it, I plan to focus on
      achieving true data ownership on the Web. One future direction is to decouple Web data from its applications, with
      mapping information residing on a public, permissioned blockchain. As such, a Web browser acts as a decentralized
      content explorer that executes user-defined, self-contained, tokenized applications. This also allows both
      versions of the Web to co-exist, with current centralized websites acting as both content and application
      providers.</p>
